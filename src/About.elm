# Booklib

With this app, you can easily keep track of your reading.  If you wish,
you can also take notes on books you have read.  In a future release,
there will be a way to share book lists with other readers.  Eventually
there will be a phone mode.

Enjoy!

## Editing a book

- Click on a book title once to show more info

- Click on it again (or double-click) to edit the book,
e.g., update the number of pages you have read.

- Click on it a third time to go back to the book list.

## Sorting the book list

Click on the column headers to change the way the book
list is sorted. The left-most column can read **N** (for normal)
**R** (for most recent first), or **@** (for anything else).
Click to change.

Do let me know if you find bugs or things that don't work
quite right for you. I am open to suggestions about
improving this app.
